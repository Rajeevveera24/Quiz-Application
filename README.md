This is a simple quiz application that I created as a part of my selection process for an internship during my first year of college.

The program reads a set of questions from a text file (questions.txt), randomly selects ten of them and displays them to the user one by one.

The questions belong to three categories: Sports, General and Music.

I have created a data structure to store a question along with its answer and type, and used of an array of such objects to store the selected questions.

After the user has completed the quiz, the total score and category wise scores are displayed on the screen.

To take the quiz, run the .exe file and follow the instructions given.
While answering the questions, enter the options in Upper case.
